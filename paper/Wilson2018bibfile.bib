	abstract = {Levels of expression of the transcription factor Pax6 vary throughout corticogenesis in a rostro-lateralhigh to caudo-mediallow gradient across the cortical proliferative zone. Previous loss-of-function studies have indicated that Pax6 is required for normal cortical progenitor proliferation, neuronal differentiation, cortical lamination and cortical arealization, but whether and how its level of expression affects its function is unclear. We studied the developing cortex of PAX77 YAC transgenic mice carrying several copies of the human PAX6 locus with its full complement of regulatory regions. We found that PAX77 embryos express Pax6 in a normal spatial pattern, with levels up to three times higher than wild type. By crossing PAX77 mice with a new YAC transgenic line that reports Pax6 expression (DTy54), we showed that increased expression is limited by negative autoregulation. Increased expression reduces proliferation of late cortical progenitors specifically, and analysis of PAX77<->wild-type chimeras indicates that the defect is cell autonomous. We analyzed cortical arealization in PAX77 mice and found that, whereas the loss of Pax6 shifts caudal cortical areas rostrally, Pax6 overexpression at levels predicted to shift rostral areas caudally has very little effect. These findings indicate that Pax6 levels are stabilized by autoregulation, that the proliferation of cortical progenitors is sensitive to altered Pax6 levels and that cortical arealization is not.},

	abstract = {Thalamic innervation of each neocortical area is vital to cortical function, but the developmental strategies that guide axons to specific areas remain unclear. We took a new approach to determine the contribution of intracortical cues. The cortical patterning molecule fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) was misexpressed in the cortical primordium to rearrange the area map. Thalamic axons faithfully tracked changes in area position and innervated duplicated somatosensory barrel fields induced by an ectopic source of FGF8, indicating that thalamic axons indeed use intracortical positional information. Because cortical layers are generated in temporal order, FGF8 misexpression at different ages could be used to shift regional identity in the subplate and cortical plate either in or out of register. Thalamic axons showed strikingly different responses in the two different conditions, disclosing sources of positional guidance in both subplate and cortical plate. Unexpectedly, axon trajectories indicated that an individual neocortical layer could provide not only laminar but also area-specific guidance. Our findings demonstrate that thalamocortical axons are directed by sequential, positional cues within the cortex and implicate FGF8 as an indirect regulator of thalamocortical innervation.},

	abstract = {Self-organization and natural selection are fundamental forces that shape the natural world. Substantial progress in understanding how these forces interact has been made through the study of abstract models. Further progress may be made by identifying a model system in which the interaction between self-organization and selection can be investigated empirically. To this end, we investigate how the self-organizing thermoregulatory huddling behaviours displayed by many species of mammals might influence natural selection of the genetic components of metabolism. By applying a simple evolutionary algorithm to a well-established model of the interactions between environmental, morphological, physiological and behavioural components of thermoregulation, we arrive at a clear, but counterintuitive, prediction: rodents that are able to huddle together in cold environments should evolve a lower thermal conductance at a faster rate than animals reared in isolation. The model therefore explains how evolution can be accelerated as a consequence of relaxed selection, and it predicts how the effect may be exaggerated by an increase in the litter size, i.e. by an increase in the capacity to use huddling behaviours for thermoregulation. Confirmation of these predictions in future experiments with rodents would constitute strong evidence of a mechanism by which self-organization can guide natural selection.},

  abstract = {A full account of behavioral development in rats must include the
	ontogeny of both individual and group behavior. Most of our accumulated
	knowledge, however, pertains to individual ontogenesis. Group behavior
	and its development are readily seen in the huddling behavior of
	rat pups. A rat huddle is an entity with characteristics and capabilities
	distinct from those of the individuals that comprise it. The huddle
	is a natural context for acquiring olfactory preferences for species
	odors. Olfactory learning in a huddle involves thermal and tactile
	stimulation from the mother's body but, surprisingly, not the rewards
	of suckling or of milk transfer. Although there is complete developmental
	continuity of huddling behavior, the sensory controls of huddling
	change dramatically during the first 2 weeks of postnatal life. Huddling
	behavior is initially controlled by thermal cues ("physiological
	huddling") and then becomes dominated by olfactory stimuli ("filial
	huddling"). The complex group behavior of huddling was modeled successfully
	with computational methods. Group behavior emerges from individual
	interactions, guided entirely by rules of individual behavior (no
	rules for group behavior). Three simple rules of autonomous activity/inactivity
	can spawn the patterns of aggregon formation displayed by groups

	pups and observing them in huddles by means of time-lapse videography.
	It was found that individual animals circulate throught the huddle,

 abstract = {We believe that punctuational change dominates the history of life: evolution is concentrated in very rapid events of speciation (geologically instantaneous, even if tolerably continuous in ecological time). Most species, during their geological history, either do not change in any appreciable way, or else they fluctuate mildly in morphology, with no apparent direction. Phyletic gradualism is very rare and too slow, in any case, to produce the major events of evolution. Evolutionary trends are not the product of slow, directional transformation within lineages; they represent the differential success of certain species within a clade-speciation may be random with respect to the direction of a trend (Wright's rule). As an a priori bias, phyletic gradualism has precluded any fair assessment of evolutionary tempos and modes. It could not be refuted by empirical catalogues constructed in its light because it excluded contrary information as the artificial result of an imperfect fossil record. With the model of punctuated equilibria, an unbiased distribution of evolutionary tempos can be established by treating stasis as data and by recording the pattern of change for all species in an assemblage. This distribution of tempos can lead to strong inferences about modes. If, as we predict, the punctuational tempo is prevalent, then speciation-not phyletic evolution-must be the dominant mode of evolution. We argue that virtually none of the examples brought forward to refute our model can stand as support for phyletic gradualism; many are so weak and ambiguous that they only reflect the persistent bias for gradualism still deeply embedded in paleontological thought. Of the few stronger cases, we concentrate on Gingerich's data for Hyopsodus and argue that it provides an excellent example of species selection under our model. We then review the data of several studies that have supported our model since we published it five years ago. The record of human evolution seems to provide a particularly good example: no gradualism has been detected within any hominid taxon, and many are long-ranging; the trend to larger brains arises from differential success of essentially static taxa. The data of molecular genetics support our assumption that large genetic changes often accompany the process of speciation. Phyletic gradualism was an a priori assertion from the start-it was never "seen" in the rocks; it expressed the cultural and political biases of 19th century liberalism. Huxley advised Darwin to eschew it as an "unnecessary difficulty." We think that it has now become an empirical fallacy. A punctuational view of change may have wide validity at all levels of evolutionary processes. At the very least, it deserves consideration as an alternate way of interpreting the history of life.},

ABSTRACT={The neocortex is the part of the mammalian brain that is involved in perception, cognition, and volitional motor control. It is a highly dynamic structure that is dramatically altered within the lifetime of an animal and in different lineages throughout the course of evolution. These alterations account for the remarkable variations in behavior that species exhibit. Of particular interest is how these cortical phenotypes change within the lifetime of the individual and eventually evolve in species over time. Because we cannot study the evolution of the neocortex directly we use comparative analysis to appreciate the types of changes that have been made to the neocortex and the similarities that exist across taxa. Developmental studies inform us about how these phenotypic transitions may arise by alterations in developmental cascades or changes in the physical environment in which the brain develops. Both genes and the sensory environment contribute to aspects of the phenotype and similar features, such as the size of a cortical field, can be altered in a variety of ways. Although both genes and the laws of physics place constraints on the evolution of the neocortex, mammals have evolved a number of mechanisms that allow them to loosen these constraints and often alter the course of their own evolution. }

There is growing experimental evidence that their emergence and development is controlled by both epigenetic and genetic factors. The latter were recently implicated as dominating the early cortical area specification. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that explicitly considers the genetic factors and that is able to explain several sets of experiments on cortical area regulation involving transcription factors Emx2 and Pax6, and fibroblast growth factor FGF8. The model consists of the dynamics of thalamo-cortical connections modulated by signaling molecules that are regulated genetically, and by axonal competition for neocortical space. The model can make predictions and provides a basic mathematical framework for the early development of the thalamo-cortical connections and area patterning that can be further refined as more experimental facts become known.",

	with higher levels in the former group, most probably because light
	pups that have a less favorable body mass-to-volume ratio and more
	often occupy peripheral positions in the litter huddle, make a greater
	effort to reach thermally favorable central positions. In conclusion,

	Most of the knowledge on thermoregulatory physiology has emerged

	understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Tb.
	Ectothermic vertebrates-fish, amphibians and reptiles-thermoregulate
	essentially by behavioural mechanisms. With few exceptions, both
	endotherms and ectotherms develop fever (a regulated increase in
	Tb) in response to exogenous pyrogens, and regulated hypothermia
	(anapyrexia) in response to hypoxia. This review focuses on the mechanisms,

	Here, we describe a simple method for assessing associative abilities
	in newborn mice. We used a two-odour-choice classical conditioning
	paradigm in mice from the day of birth (post-natal age 0, P0) to
	P6. Acquisition required 20 trials: 10 trials during which the pups
	were placed over the conditioned stimulus (CS+) odour (lemon or peppermint)
	for 30s and simultaneously stroked gently with a paintbrush and 10
	trials during which the pups were placed over the other odour (CS-)
	for 30s, without stroking. Then, the pups were subjected to five
	odour-preference trials to test for conditioning. This sequence of
	five trials was repeated after 5 and 24h to assess retention of the
	conditioned odour preference. During the immediate post-acquisition
	sequence, the pups spent significantly more time over the CS+ than
	over the CS- (p<0.0001). No extinction of the conditioned preference
	was observed during this test. No preference was observed after 5
	or 24h, indicating that the conditioned response was promptly lost.
	Conditioning was effective as soon as P0-P1. Thus, conditioning may
	emerge in newborn mice sooner than previously reported. This paradigm
	is well suited to phenotyping of large samples of genetically altered
	mice and may shed light on the role for genes in paediatric cognitive

	to environmental perturbations as if of one mind. Most studies in
	collective animal behavior have aimed to understand how a globally
	ordered state may emerge from simple behavioral rules. Less effort
	has been devoted to understanding the origin of collective response,
	namely the way the group as a whole reacts to its environment. Yet,
	in the presence of strong predatory pressure on the group, collective
	response may yield a significant adaptive advantage. Here we suggest
	that collective response in animal groups may be achieved through
	scale-free behavioral correlations. By reconstructing the 3D position
	and velocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we
	measured to what extent the velocity fluctuations of different birds
	are correlated to each other. We found that the range of such spatial
	correlation does not have a constant value, but it scales with the
	linear size of the flock. This result indicates that behavioral correlations
	are scale free: The change in the behavioral state of one animal
	affects and is affected by that of all other animals in the group,
	no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations provide
	each animal with an effective perception range much larger than the
	direct interindividual interaction range, thus enhancing global response
	to perturbations. Our results suggest that flocks behave as critical
	systems, poised to respond maximally to environmental perturbations.},

	and often-mentioned interspecific patterns to emerge from studies

	comparison of predictions derived from interspecific studies with
	data gathered from within-species studies in order to explore the
	mechanisms and functional significance of the putative adaptive responses
	encapsulated by the food-habit hypothesis. We suggest that, in addition
	to concentrating on the relationship among diet quality, internal
	morphology, and BMR, new studies should also attempt to unravel alternative
	mechanisms that shape the interaction between diet and BMR, such
	as enzymatic plasticity, and the use of energy-saving mechanisms,
	such as torpor. Another avenue for future study is the measurement
	of the effects of diet quality on other components of the energy
	budget, such as maximum thermogenic and sustainable metabolic rates.
	It is possible that the effects of diet quality operate on such components
	rather than directly on BMR, which might then push or pull along
	changes in these traits. Results from intraspecific studies suggest
	that the factors responsible for the association between diet and
	BMR at an ecological timescale might not be the same as those that
	promoted the evolution of this correlation. Further analyses should
	consider how much of a role the proximate and ultimate processes
	have played in the evolution of BMR.},

We now have a new starting point for understanding how the cortical area map is established and how maps may change and evolve. Here we review findings that signaling molecules secreted from distinct cortical signaling centers establish positional information in the cortical primordium and regulate regional growth. In other embryonic systems, positional signals would regulate the patterned expression of transcription factors, leading, in a gene regulatory cascade, to the patterned differentiation of the tissue. We discuss candidate transcription factors with respect to such a model of cortical patterning. Finally, embryonic structures interact to pattern one another. We review data suggesting that the thalamus and cortex are patterned independently then interact to generate the final cortical area map. }

abstract="Telencephalic patterning centers, defined by the discrete expression domains of distinct morphogens, Fgf s in the commissural plate (CoP), Wnt s and Bmp s in the cortical hem, and a ventral domain of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), are postulated to establish during development the initial patterning of the telencepahlon, including the neocortex. We show that the expression patterns of Sp5, Sp8, and Sp9, members of the Sp8-like family that are homologues of Drosophila buttonhead, correlate during early embryonic development with these three telencephalic patterning centers. To study potential functional relationships, we focused on Sp8, because it is transiently expressed in the CoP coincident with the expression of Fgf8, a morphogen implicated in area patterning of the neocortex. We also show that Sp8 is expressed in cortical progenitors in a high to low anterior-medial to posterior-lateral gradient across the ventricular zone. We used in utero electroporation of full-length and chimeric expression constructs to perform gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies of interactions between Sp8 and Fgf8 and their roles in cortical area patterning. We show that Fgf8 and Sp8 exhibit reciprocal induction in vivo in the embryonic telencephalon. Sp8 also induces downstream targets of Fgf8, including ETS transcription factors. In vitro assays show that Sp8 binds Fgf8 regulatory elements and is a direct transcriptional activator of Fgf8. We also show that Sp8 induction of Fgf8 is repressed by Emx2 in vitro, suggesting a mechanism to limit Fgf8 expression to the CoP. In vivo expression of a dominant negative Sp8 in the CoP indicates that Sp8 maintains expression of Fgf8 and also its effect on area patterning. Ectopic expression of Sp8 in anterior or posterior cortical poles induces significant anterior or posterior shifts in area patterning, respectively, paralleled by changes in expression of gene markers of positional identity. These effects of Sp8 on area patterning oppose those induced by ectopic expression of Fgf8, suggesting that in parallel to regulating Fgf8 expression, Sp8 also activates a distinct signaling pathway for cortical area patterning. In summary, Sp8 and Fgf8 robustly induce one another, and may act to balance the anterior-posterior area patterning of the cortex.",

An organizer is a portion of the embryo producing signals that lead to the creation of a patterned mature structure from an embryonic primordium. Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is a morphogen that disperses from a rostromedial source in the neocortical primordium (NP), forms a rostral-to-caudal (R/C) gradient, and regulates embryonic and neonatal R/C patterns of gene expression in neocortex. Whether FGF8 also has organizer activity that generates the postnatal neocortical area map is uncertain. To test this possibility, new sources of FGF8 were introduced into the mouse NP with in utero microelectroporation at embryonic day 10.5, close to the estimated peak of area patterning. Results differed depending on the position of ectopic FGF8. Ectopic FGF8 in the caudalmost NP could duplicate somatosensory cortex (S1) and primary visual cortex (V1). FGF8 delivered to the midlateral NP generated a sulcus separating rostral and caudal portions of the NP, in effect creating duplicate NPs. In the caudal NP, ectopic FGF8 induced a second, inclusive area map, containing frontal cortex, S1, V1, and primary auditory areas. Moreover, duplicate S1 showed plasticity to sensory deprivation, and duplicate V1 responded to visual stimuli. Our findings implicate FGF8 as an organizer signal, and its source in the rostromedial telencephalon as an organizer of the neocortical area map.},

The transcription factors EMX1, EMX2, and PAX6 have been proposed to regulate arealization. Emx1 and Emx2 are expressed by progenitor cells in a low rostrolateral to high caudomedial gradient across the embryonic neocortex, and Pax6 is expressed in a high rostrolateral to low caudomedial gradient. Recent evidence has suggested that EMX2 and PAX6 have a role in the genetic regulation of arealization. Here we use a panel of seven genes (Cad6, Cad8, Id2,RZRβ, p75, EphA7, and ephrin-A5) representative of a broad range of proteins as complementary markers of positional identity to obtain a more thorough assessment of the suggested roles for EMX2 and PAX6 in arealization, and in addition to assess the proposed but untested role for EMX1 in arealization. Orderly changes in the size and positioning of domains of marker expression in Emx2 andPax6 mutants strongly imply that rostrolateral areas (motor and somatosensory) are expanded, whereas caudomedial areas (visual) are reduced in Emx2 mutants and that opposite effects occur in Pax6 mutants, consistent with their opposing gradients of expression. In contrast, patterns of marker expression, as well as the distribution of area-specific thalamocortical projections, appear normal in Emx1mutants, indicating that they do not exhibit changes in arealization. This lack of a defined role for EMX1 in arealization is supported by our finding of similar shifts in patterns of marker expression inEmx1; Emx2 double mutants as in Emx2 mutants. Thus, our findings indicate that EMX2 and PAX6 regulate, in opposing manners, arealization of the neocortex and impart positional identity to cortical cells, whereas EMX1 appears not to have a role in this process.},

Progress on this problem will give insight into how the brain works and what can go wrong to cause developmental disorders like autism and learning disability. This paper examines the development of the outer part of the mammalian brain, the cerebral cortex. This part of the brain contains different areas with specialised functions. Over the past decade, several genes have been identified that play a major role in the development of cortical areas. During development, these genes are expressed in different patterns across the surface of the cortex. Experiments have shown that these genes interact with each other so that they each regulate how much other genes in the group are expressed. However, the experimental data are consistent with many different regulatory networks. In this study, we use a computational model to systematically screen many possible networks. This allows us to predict which regulatory interactions between these genes are important for the patterns of gene expression in the cortex to develop correctly.},

  abstract = {Rats rhythmically sweep their whiskers over object features, generating
	sequential deflections of whisker arcs. Such moving wavefronts of
	whisker deflection are likely to be fundamental elements of natural
	somatosensory input. To determine how moving wavefronts are represented
	in somatosensory cortex (S1), we measured single- and multiunit neural
	responses in S1 of anesthetized rats to moving wavefronts applied
	through a piezoelectric whisker deflector array. Wavefronts consisted
	of sequential deflections of individual whisker arcs, which moved
	progressively across the whisker array. Starting position (starting
	arc), direction, and velocity of wavefronts were varied. Neurons
	responded strongly only when wavefront starting position included
	their principal whisker (PW). When wavefronts started at neighboring
	positions and swept through the PW, responses to the PW arc were
	suppressed by <or=95\%, and responses over the entire wavefront duration
	were suppressed by <or=60\% compared with wavefronts that initiated
	with the PW. Suppression occurred with interarc deflection delays
	of >or=5 ms, was maximal at 20 ms, and recovered within 100-200 ms.
	Suppression of PW arc responses during wavefronts was largely independent
	of wavefront direction. However, layer 2/3 neurons showed direction
	selectivity for responses to the entire wavefront (the entire sequence
	of SW and PW arc deflection). Wavefront direction selectivity was
	correlated with receptive field somatotopy and reflected differential
	responses to the specific SWs that were deflected first in a wavefront.
	These results indicate that suppressive interwhisker interactions
	shape responses to wavefronts, resulting in increased salience of
	wavefront starting position, and, in some neurons, preference for
	wavefront direction.},

  abstract = {We present eco-genetic modeling as a flexible tool for exploring the
	course and rates of multi-trait life-history evolution in natural
	populations. We build on existing modeling approaches by combining
	features that facilitate studying the ecological and evolutionary
	dynamics of realistically structured populations. In particular,
	the joint consideration of age and size structure enables the analysis
	of phenotypically plastic populations with more than a single growth
	trajectory, and ecological feedback is readily included in the form
	of density dependence and frequency dependence. Stochasticity and
	life-history trade-offs can also be implemented. Critically, eco-genetic
	models permit the incorporation of salient genetic detail such as
	a population's genetic variances and covariances and the corresponding
	heritabilities, as well as the probabilistic inheritance and phenotypic
	expression of quantitative traits. These inclusions are crucial for
	predicting rates of evolutionary change on both contemporary and
	longer timescales. An eco-genetic model can be tightly coupled with
	empirical data and therefore may have considerable practical relevance,
	in terms of generating testable predictions and evaluating alternative
	management measures. To illustrate the utility of these models, we
	present as an example an eco-genetic model used to study harvest-induced
	evolution of multiple traits in Atlantic cod. The predictions of
	our model (most notably that harvesting induces a genetic reduction
	in age and size at maturation, an increase or decrease in growth
	capacity depending on the minimum-length limit, and an increase in
	reproductive investment) are corroborated by patterns observed in
	wild populations. The predicted genetic changes occur together with
	plastic changes that could phenotypically mask the former. Importantly,
	our analysis predicts that evolutionary changes show little signs
	of reversal following a harvest moratorium. This illustrates how
	predictions offered by eco-genetic models can enable and guide evolutionarily
	sustainable resource management.},

	mammals and birds from low latitudes (0-30°), including species from
	tropical and subtropical regions, are heterothermic and employ torpor.
	Use of torpor is especially important for bats because they are small,
	expend large amounts of energy when active, rely on a fluctuating
	food supply, and have only a limited capacity for storage of fat.
	Patterns of torpor in tropical/subtropical bats are highly variable,
	but short bouts of torpor with relatively high body temperatures
	(T(b)) are most common. Hibernation (a sequence of multiday bouts
	of torpor) has been reported for free-ranging subtropical tree-dwelling
	vespertilionids, cave-dwelling hipposiderids, and house-dwelling
	molossids. The observed range of minimum T(b) is ∼6-30 °C, and the
	reduction of energy expenditure through the use of torpor, in comparison

	hibernation in diverse groups of tropical/subtropical bats, suggests
	that heterothermy is an ancestral chiropteran trait. Although data

	whether this dynamic sensory processing was reflected in the spatial
	and temporal properties of neurons in layer V of the 'whisker area'
	in the rat primary somatosensory cortex. We found that the majority

	receptive fields (i.e. individual cells responded best to different
	whiskers as a function of post-stimulus time), and that the excitatory
	responses of surround whiskers formed a spatial gradient of excitation
	that seemed to reflect the greater use of the ventral and caudal
	whiskers during natural behaviors. Analyses of ensembles of layer
	V neurons revealed that single-whisker stimuli activated a portion
	of layer V that extends well beyond a single cortical column (average
	of 5.6 barrel cortical columns). Based on these results, we conclude
	that the rat primary somatosensory cortex does not appear to operate

  abstract = {Most models of fish growth and predation dynamics assume that food
	ingestion rate is the major component of the energy budget affected
	by prey availability, while active metabolism is invariant (here
	called constant activity hypothesis). However, increasing empirical
	evidence supports an opposing view: fish tend to adjust their foraging
	activity to maintain reasonably constant ingestion levels in the
	face of varying prey density and/or quality (the constant satiation
	hypothesis). In this paper, we use a simple but flexible model of
	fish bioenergetics to show that constant satiation is likely to occur
	in fish that optimize both net production rate and life history.
	The model includes swimming speed as an explicit measure of foraging
	activity leading to both energy gains (through prey ingestion) and
	losses (through active metabolism). The fish is assumed to be a particulate
	feeder that has to swim between consecutive individual prey captures,
	and that shifts its diet ontogenetically from smaller to larger prey.
	The prey community is represented by a negative power-law size spectrum.
	From these rules, we derive the net production of fish as a function
	of the size spectrum, and this in turn establishes a formal link
	between the optimal life history (i.e. maximum body size) and prey
	community structure. In most cases with realistic parameter values,
	optimization of life history ensures that: (i) a constantly satiated
	fish preying on a steep size spectrum will stop growing and invest
	all its surplus energy in reproduction before satiation becomes too
	costly; (ii) conversely, a fish preying on a shallow size spectrum
	will grow large enough for satiation to be present throughout most
	of its ontogeny. These results provide a mechanistic basis for previous
	empirical findings, and call for the inclusion of active metabolism
	as a major factor limiting growth potential and the numerical response
	of predators in theoretical studies of food webs.},

	Aptenodytes forsteri linked to their huddling behaviour, the key
	factor that allows them to assume their incubating task while undergoing
	a long fast. Drawing on new studies by our team, this review examines
	the energetic benefits accrued from huddling and estimates the respective
	contributions of wind protection, exposure to mild ambient temperatures,
	reduction in cold-exposed body surfaces and body temperature adjustments
	in these energy savings. The metabolic rate of 'loosely grouped'
	birds (restrained in small groups of 5-10 individuals, which are
	unable to huddle effectively) is reduced by 39\% compared to metabolic
	rate of 'isolated' birds, with 32\% of these energetic benefits due
	to wind protection. In addition, metabolic rate of 'free-ranging'
	emperors, i.e. able to move freely and to huddle, is on average 21\%
	lower than that of 'loosely grouped' birds. Exposure to mild ambient
	temperatures within the groups and reduction in cold-exposed body
	surfaces while huddling, though overestimated, would represent a
	38\% metabolic reduction. About two thirds of metabolic lowering
	is attributable to the reduction in cold-exposed body surfaces and
	one third to the mild microclimate created within the groups. Moreover,
	body temperature adjustments contribute to these energetic benefits:
	maintaining body temperatures 1 degrees C lower would represent a
	7-17\% reduction in energy expenditure. These processes, linked together,
	explain how huddling emperors save energy and maintain a constant
	body temperature, which ensures a successful incubation in the midst

  abstract = {Huddling can be defined as an active and close aggregation of animals.
	It is a cooperative group behaviour, permitting individuals involved
	in social thermoregulation to minimize heat loss and thereby lower
	their energy expenditure, and possibly allowing them to reallocate
	the saved energy to other functions such as growth or reproduction.
	Huddling is especially important in the case of animals faced with
	high heat loss due to a high surface-to-volume ratio, poor insulation,
	or living in cold environments. Although numerous experimental studies
	have focused on the huddling behaviour of a wide range of species,
	to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to review the various
	implications of this widely used behavioural strategy. Huddling allows
	individuals to maximise energy savings by (1) decreasing their cold-exposed
	body surface area, (2) reducing their heat loss through warming of
	ambient temperatures surrounding the group, and (3) eventually lowering
	their body temperature through physiological processes. Huddling
	provides substantial energy savings and is estimated to reduce energy
	expenditure by between 6 and 53\%. Broad variations in the energetic
	benefits of huddling depend on the number of individuals and species
	involved in huddles, the ambient temperatures to which individuals
	are exposed and the density of the aggregations. It has been shown
	that huddling individuals have increased survival, a lower food intake,
	a decreased body mass loss, increased growth rate, reduced water
	loss, and/or a more constant body temperature together with a significant
	reduction in metabolic rate. Though huddling has been studied widely,
	this review reveals the intricacies of this adaptive behaviour.},

  abstract = {Within their litter, young altricial mammals compete for energy (constraining
	growth and survival) but cooperate for warmth. The aim of this study
	was to examine the mechanisms by which huddling in altricial infants
	influences individual heat production and loss, while providing public
	warmth. Although considered as a textbook example, it is surprising
	to note that physiological mechanisms underlying huddling are still
	not fully characterised.The brown adipose tissue (BAT) contribution
	to energy output was assessed as a function of the ability of rabbit
	(Oryctolagus cuniculus) pups to huddle (placed in groups of 6 and
	2, or isolated) and of their thermoregulatory capacities (non-insulated
	before 5 days old and insulated at ca. 10 days old). BAT contribution
	of pups exposed to cold was examined by combining techniques of infrared
	thermography (surface temperature), indirect calorimetry (total energy
	expenditure, TEE) and telemetry (body temperature). Through local
	heating, the huddle provided each pup whatever their age with an
	ambient "public warmth" in the cold, which particularly benefited
	non-insulated pups. Huddling allowed pups facing a progressive cold
	challenge to buffer the decreasing ambient temperature by delaying
	the activation of their thermogenic response, especially when fur-insulated.
	In this way, huddling permitted pups to effectively shift from a
	non-insulated to a pseudo-insulated thermal state while continuously
	allocating energy to growth. The high correlation between TEE and
	the difference in surface temperatures between BAT and back areas
	of the body reveals that energy loss for non-shivering thermogenesis
	is the major factor constraining the amount of energy allocated to
	growth in non-insulated altricial pups.By providing public warmth
	with minimal individual costs at a stage of life when pups are the
	most vulnerable, huddling buffers cold challenges and ensures a constant
	allocation of energy to growth by reducing BAT activation.},

	The current study used high-speed video analysis to investigate whisker
	movements in untrained, freely moving rats encountering unexpected,
	vertical surfaces. A prominent feature of rat vibrissal movement
	is the repeated posterior-anterior sweep of the whiskers in which
	the macrovibrissae are seen to move largely in synchrony. Here we

	the size of the arc, or "spread," between the whiskers. Observed
	spread is shown to vary over the whisk cycle and to substantially
	decrease during exploration of an unexpected surface. We further
	show that the timing of whisker movements is affected by surface
	contact such that 1) the whiskers rapidly cease forward protraction
	following an initial, unexpected contact, and may do so even more
	rapidly following contact with the same surface in the subsequent
	whisk cycle, and 2) retraction velocity is reduced following this
	latter contact, leading to longer second-contact durations. This
	evidence is taken to support two hypotheses: 1) that the relative
	velocities of different whiskers may be actively controlled by the
	rat and 2) that control of whisker velocity and timing may serve
	to increase the number and duration of whisker-surface contacts while
	ensuring that such contacts are made with a light touch.},

	time of the day. It was found that the total time and the duration
	of each period that the mother spends with its litter shows an orderly
	decrease over the 21 days post-partum. Further analyses of these
	data indicated that there is a 24-hr rhythm in maternal behaviour.
	The rhythm appears to be inversely related to and may be a direct
	reflection of the rat's characteristic 24-hr activity cycle. A comparison
	of the time spent with the litter with data obtained from a modified
	version of Seitz's maternal-behaviour scale yielded similar changes
	over time for those tests of the scale which did not involve any
	disruption of the ongoing behaviour of the mother or litter. Otherwise,
	there was no consistent relationship between these two measures or
	within the scale itself. Administration of the maternal-behaviour
	scale to females rearing litters in a single cage indicated that
	the above findings could be attributed to the use of the dual-chambered
	apparatus. These data further suggested that some aspects of the
	maternal-behaviour scale may be artifacts of the conditions of housing
	or method of administration, and may reflect emotional reactivity
	rather than maternal behaviour, per se. The continuous recording
	of maternal behaviour was also found to differentiate between females
	rearing large and small litters. The time spent with the litter over
	the 21-day post-partum period decreased more rapidly in females rearing
	litters of twelve than in females rearing litters of four animals.
	The data are interpreted as support for the assumption that the time
	that a lactating rat spends with its litter can be taken as a reflection
	of maternal behaviour. The main advantages of this procedure are
	that it provides a continuous recording that is not subject to sampling
	error or experimenter bias, and it takes advantage of the ongoing
	mother-litter interactions which are initiated by the animals themselves
	rather than forced by the proximity of a single cage or by the intervention
	of an experimenter. ¬© 1969.},

	Heat production (oxygen consumption-VÃá(O2)) and body temperature

	(4-8-week-old) porcupines, with a body mass between 1340-1993 g during

	kept together in the metabolic chamber and the values were compared
	with those obtained from single porcupines. Overall minimal thermal

	The newborn porcupines can regulate their body temperature at T(a)s
	between 10-28¬∞C. VÃá(O)2 measured at lower critical point is 0.602

	allocate it to growth. Apart from decreasing vulnerability, delaying

  abstract = {Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic effector abundant in most
	mammalian infants. For multiparous species such as rats and mice,
	the interscapular BAT deposit provides both an emergency "thermal
	blanket" and a target for nestmates seeking warmth, thereby increasing
	the cohesiveness of huddling groups. Sex differences in BAT regulation
	and thermogenesis have been documented in a number of species, including
	mice (Mus musculus)--with females generally exhibiting relative upregulation
	of BAT. It is nonetheless unknown whether this difference affects
	the behavioral dynamics occurring within huddles of infant rodents.
	We investigated sex differences in BAT thermogenesis and its relation
	to contact while huddling in eight-day-old C57BL/6 mouse pups using
	infrared thermography, scoring of contact, and causal modeling of
	the relation between interscapular temperature relative to other
	pups in the huddle (T IS (rel)) and contacts while huddling. We found
	that females were warmer than their male siblings during cold challenge,
	under conditions both in which pups were isolated and in which pups
	could actively huddle in groups of six (3 male, 3 female). This difference
	garnered females significantly more contacts from other pups than
	males during cold-induced huddling. Granger analyses revealed a significant
	negative feedback relationship between contacts with males and T
	IS (rel) for females, and positive feedback between contacts with
	females and T IS (rel) for males, indicating that male pups drained
	heat from female siblings while huddling. Significant sex assortment
	nonetheless occurred, such that females made more contacts with other
	females than expected by chance, apparently outcompeting males for
	access to each other. These results provide further evidence of enhanced
	BAT thermogenesis in female mice. Slight differences in BAT can significantly
	structure the behavioral dynamics occurring in huddles, resulting
	in differences in the quantity and quality of contacts obtained by
	the individuals therein, creating sex differences in behavioral interactions

  abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary
	of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review,
	we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing
	realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it
	was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the
	somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single
	modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently,
	examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas,
	expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different
	structures and principles. A ‘column’ now refers to cells in any
	vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive
	field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same
	eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably,
	ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others.
	In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by
	searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate
	with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has
	been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require
	ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that
	the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable
	among members of the same species, or even in different portions
	of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal
	a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose.
	More broadly, the term ‘column’ also denotes the periodic termination
	of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many
	instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with
	some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches
	in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide
	cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing
	streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed
	by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive
	concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding
	cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex
	will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections
	and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various

	evidence from our work on domestic and wild European rabbits, and

	the proposition that in mammals early sibling relations contribute
	to the development of individual differences in these three domains
	and thereby to long-term behavioral differences of the kind we might
	consider part of an animal's behavioral style or personality. First
	we report a consistent and marked negative relation between litter
	size and individuals' body mass at birth and weaning, as well as
	marked within-litter differences in prenatal body mass and placental
	efficiency. We then report individual differences in preweaning behaviors
	associated with these morphological variables such as position occupied
	in the litter huddle and development of motor ability, as well as
	physiological differences in thermoregulation, immune parameters,
	and endocrine indicators of stress. Finally, we report first evidence
	from wild rabbits that early relations among littermates may have
	long-term consequences for individual differences in behavioral style.
	We conclude that in mammals, individual differences in early growth,
	physiology and behavior potentially important for the development
	of animal personality, are shaped to an appreciable extent by early

	detection of single action potentials from evoked calcium transients
	revealed low spontaneous firing rates (0.25 Hz), variable response

	weak angular tuning of L2/3 neurons. On average, both the single-neuron

	were higher in the barrel column than above septa or in neighboring
	columns. Within the barrel column, mean response probability was
	highest in the center (0.4) and declined toward the barrel border.
	Neuronal pairs showed correlations in both spontaneous and sensory-evoked
	activity that depended on the location of the neurons. Correlation
	decreased with increasing distance between neurons and, for neuronal
	pairs the same distance apart, with distance of the pair from the

	Subthreshold but also spiking receptive fields in the barrel cortex
	encompass a large number of vibrissae and it seems likely that the

	the multiple-whisker interactions encountered by the animal during

	the dependence of the spatial structure of cortical receptive fields

	to randomized whisker deflections (sparse noise) to characterize
	the receptive fields that result from caudal and rostral directions
	of whisker deflection. We observed that the functionally determined
	principal whisker, the whisker eliciting the strongest response with
	the shortest latency, differed according to the direction of whisker
	deflection. Thus, for a given neuron, maximal responses to opposite
	directions of whisker deflections could be spatially separated. This
	spatial separation resulted in a displacement of the center of mass
	between the rostral and caudal subfields and was accompanied by differences
	between response latencies in rostral and caudal directions of whisker
	deflection. Such direction-dependent receptive field organization

  abstract = {The energy expenditure of endotherms, through its impact on the rate
	of reproduction, affects their ability to withstand competition,
	to tolerate environmental disturbances, and to endure predation.
	The fecundity of eutherian mammals increases with rate of metabolism
	because the post-natal growth rate increases and the gestation and
	conception-to-weaning periods decrease with a mass-independent increase
	in basal rate of metabolism. These correlations account for the observation
	that species that have large population fluctuations have high rates
	of metabolism and reproduction. Species with high rates of metabolism
	out-compete species with low rates when using resources that permit
	consumers to have high rates of metabolism, which explains why eutherian
	carnivores replace marsupial carnivores, none of which have high
	basal rates as a result of their form of reproduction. Fecundity
	in birds also appears to correlate with energy expenditure, which
	may account for the huge die-off of birds endemic to oceanic islands
	after the invasion of humans: island endemics, many of which have
	low rates of metabolism, are unable to increase fecundity in response
	to a human-based increase in mortality. The long-term protection
	for endotherms characterized by low rates of energy expenditure requires
	their isolation from high levels of predation and competition, conditions
	that are likely to occur only on islands free from eutherian predators
	and with low species diversity. Such endotherms may survive on continents
	if they are ecologically isolated from the general fauna.},

  abstract = {We present a general and flexible mathematical model (called SANDY)

	the phenology of arthropods. In this paper, we demonstrate how the
	model can be fitted to vital rates (i.e., rates associated with development,
	survival, hatching, and oviposition) of the two-spotted spider mite
	(Tetranychus urticae (Koch)) exposed to different constant temperatures
	ranging from 15°C to 37.5°C. SANDY was incorporated into an age-,
	stage- and sex-structured dynamic model, which was fitted to cohort
	life-tables of T. urticae conducted at five constant temperatures
	(15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C). Age- and temperature-dependent vital
	rates for the three main stages (eggs, immatures, and adults) constituting
	the life-cycle of mites were adequately described by the SANDY model.
	The modeling approach allows for simulating the growth of a population
	in a variable environment. We compared the predicted net reproductive
	rate (R0) and intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) at fluctuating
	temperatures with empirical values obtained from life-table experiments
	conducted at temperatures that changed with a daily amplitude (±0,
	±3, ±6, ±9, and ±12°C) around an average of 22°C. Results show that
	R0 decreases with increasing amplitude, while rm is more robust to
	variable temperatures. An advantage of SANDY is that the same simple
	mathematical expression can be applied to describe all the vital
	rates. Besides, the approach is not confined to modeling the influence
	of a single factor on population growth but allows for incorporating
	the combined effect of several limiting factors, provided that the
	combined effect of the factors is multiplicative.},

  abstract = {Neurons in the cerebral cortex are organized into anatomical columns,
	with ensembles of cells arranged from the surface to the white matter.
	Within a column, neurons often share functional properties, such
	as selectivity for stimulus orientation; columns with distinct properties,
	such as different preferred orientations, tile the cortical surface
	in orderly patterns. This functional architecture was discovered
	with the relatively sparse sampling of microelectrode recordings.
	Optical imaging of membrane voltage or metabolic activity elucidated
	the overall geometry of functional maps, but is averaged over many
	cells (resolution >100 microm). Consequently, the purity of functional
	domains and the precision of the borders between them could not be
	resolved. Here, we labelled thousands of neurons of the visual cortex
	with a calcium-sensitive indicator in vivo. We then imaged the activity
	of neuronal populations at single-cell resolution with two-photon
	microscopy up to a depth of 400 microm. In rat primary visual cortex,
	neurons had robust orientation selectivity but there was no discernible
	local structure; neighbouring neurons often responded to different
	orientations. In area 18 of cat visual cortex, functional maps were
	organized at a fine scale. Neurons with opposite preferences for
	stimulus direction were segregated with extraordinary spatial precision
	in three dimensions, with columnar borders one to two cells wide.
	These results indicate that cortical maps can be built with single-cell
	precision.},

  abstract = {In the visual cortex of higher mammals, neurons are arranged across
	the cortical surface in an orderly map of preferred stimulus orientations.
	This map contains 'orientation pinwheels', structures that are arranged
	like the spokes of a wheel such that orientation changes continuously
	around a centre. Conventional optical imaging first demonstrated
	these pinwheels, but the technique lacked the spatial resolution
	to determine the response properties and arrangement of cells near
	pinwheel centres. Electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated
	sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres, but it remained
	unclear whether they were arranged randomly or in an orderly fashion.
	Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in vivo to determine the microstructure
	of pinwheel centres in cat visual cortex with single-cell resolution.
	We find that pinwheel centres are highly ordered: neurons selective
	to different orientations are clearly segregated even in the very
	centre. Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the
	cortical map. This highly ordered arrangement at the level of single
	cells suggests great precision in the development of cortical circuits

  journal = {Plant Methods},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {11},
  abstract = {Roots are the classical model system to study the organization and
	dynamics of organ growth zones. Profiles of the velocity of root
	elements relative to the apex have generally been considered to be
	sigmoidal. However, recent high-resolution measurements have yielded
	bi-linear profiles, suggesting that sigmoidal profiles may be artifacts
	caused by insufficient spatio-temporal resolution. The decision whether
	an empirical velocity profile follows a sigmoidal or bi-linear distribution
	has consequences for the interpretation of the underlying biological
	processes. However, distinguishing between sigmoidal and bi-linear
	curves is notoriously problematic. A mathematical function that can
	describe both types of curve equally well would allow them to be
	distinguished by automated curve-fitting.On the basis of the mathematical
	requirements defined, we created a composite function and tested
	it by fitting it to sigmoidal and bi-linear models with different
	noise levels (Monte-Carlo datasets) and to three experimental datasets
	from roots of Gypsophila elegans, Aurinia saxatilis, and Arabidopsis
	thaliana. Fits of the function proved robust with respect to noise
	and yielded statistically sound results if care was taken to identify
	reasonable initial coefficient values to start the automated fitting
	procedure. Descriptions of experimental datasets were significantly
	better than those provided by the Richards function, the most flexible
	of the classical growth equations, even in cases in which the data
	followed a smooth sigmoidal distribution.Fits of the composite function
	introduced here provide an independent criterion for distinguishing
	sigmoidal and bi-linear growth profiles, but without forcing a dichotomous
	decision, as intermediate solutions are possible. Our function thus
	facilitates an unbiased, multiple-working hypothesis approach. While
	our discussion focusses on kinematic growth analysis, this and similar
	tailor-made functions will be useful tools wherever models of steadily
	or abruptly changing dependencies between empirical parameters are
	to be compared.},

	In both cases animals that had occupied the periphery of the huddle

  abstract = {Features of an individual's early development are frequently reported
	to alter the postnatal ontogeny in litter-bearing mammals with respect
	to various physiological parameters. We hypothesized that such effects
	might also apply to the ontogeny of personality types. On the one
	hand, litter size effects by means of more contacts with littermates,
	might lead to the development of more offensive types. On the other
	hand, smaller and less developed young from larger litters might
	be less offensive due to their lower physical capabilities to deal
	with challenging situations. We studied these contrasting hypotheses
	in young rats, which we tested in a battery of emotionality tests.
	There were clear indications for the existence of distinct behavioral
	types by means of consistencies in behavioral responses within and
	across contexts. Based on these responses, we calculated three new
	variables by PCA, which we interpreted to mainly reflect boldness,
	exploration, and anxiety. Overall, our results strongly suggest that
	the early development alters the ontogeny of personality types, with
	heavier individuals being bolder and more explorative. Furthermore,
	body mass and litter size influenced the changes in the behavioral
	responses in successive tests, further supporting the importance
	of the litter size-dependent body mass for the ontogeny of personalities.
	Anxiety also depended on litter size, however, in a nonlinear way.
	Animals born to litters of small or large sizes had higher scores,
	whereas individuals from medium-sized litters were less anxious.
	This optimum curve indicates that opposing effects of litter size

	Our study indicates that at least two main mechanisms account for

	body mass. Furthermore, our study suggests that the better milk conversion
	by heavy pups was driven by three synergistic mechanisms: heavier
	pups had comparatively more huddling partners in the nest, they did
	not need to perform large amounts of proactive behavior in order
	to reach and remain in a central position within the litter huddle,
	and they could maintain a comparatively higher body temperature most
	probably due to their more favorable surface area to volume ratio.
	In conclusion, our study of European rabbits provides strong evidence

	utilizes the score statistic and thereby facilitates computationally
	efficient significance testing based on empirical significance thresholds

	simulations showed that the power of FIA was as good as, or better

	to the level of allelic fixation in the founders, especially for
	pedigrees with few founders. A chromosome scan was conducted for
	a meat quality trait in an F(2) intercross in pigs where a mutation
	in the halothane (Ryanodine receptor, RYR1) gene with a large effect
	on meat quality was known to segregate in one founder line. FIA obtained
	significant support for the halothane-associated QTL and identified

  abstract = {Functional diversity is critical for ecosystem dynamics, stability
	and productivity. However, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs)
	which are increasingly used to simulate ecosystem functions under
	global change, condense functional diversity to plant functional
	types (PFTs) with constant parameters. Here, we develop an individual-
	and trait-based version of the DGVM LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed
	Land) called LPJmL- flexible individual traits (LPJmL-FIT) with flexible
	individual traits) which we apply to generate plant trait maps for
	the Amazon basin. LPJmL-FIT incorporates empirical ranges of five
	traits of tropical trees extracted from the TRY global plant trait
	database, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf longevity (LL), leaf
	nitrogen content (Narea ), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco
	per leaf area (vcmaxarea), and wood density (WD). To scale the individual
	growth performance of trees, the leaf traits are linked by trade-offs
	based on the leaf economics spectrum, whereas wood density is linked
	to tree mortality. No preselection of growth strategies is taking
	place, because individuals with unique trait combinations are uniformly
	distributed at tree establishment. We validate the modeled trait
	distributions by empirical trait data and the modeled biomass by
	a remote sensing product along a climatic gradient. Including trait
	variability and trade-offs successfully predicts natural trait distributions
	and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diversity
	at the local to regional scale. As sites of high climatic variability,
	the fringes of the Amazon promote trait divergence and the coexistence
	of multiple tree growth strategies, while lower plant trait diversity
	is found in the species-rich center of the region with relatively
	low climatic variability. LPJmL-FIT enables to test hypotheses on
	the effects of functional biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and
	to apply the DGVM to current challenges in ecosystem management from

	However, re-analyses of these studies have revealed serious and systematic
	methodological errors. In retrospect, this is exactly what should
	have been expected given that female mammals exhibit considerable
	ovarian cycle-length variability, which prevents synchrony. Despite
	the diversity of cycle lengths in mammals, little attention has been
	paid to possible adaptive functions of cycle-length in female mate
	choice. Thus an individual-based model of Norway rats is described
	here that uses actual data from an experimentally constructed habitat.
	Results showed that synchrony is costly to females in achieving matings
	with high quality males because synchrony forces female-female competition.
	Synchrony can be avoided by evolving longer cycles, but there are
	limits on cycle length due to the cost of waiting. Furthermore, it
	is possible for inter- and intra-female cycle length variability
	to be evolutionarily stable within a population; thus offering a
	plausible explanation for some of the diversity observed in ovarian
	cycle lengths in female mammals.},

	tropical mammals and birds have a basal metabolic rate that fits
	the standard mouse to elephant curve, i.e., the basal metabolic rate
	is determined by an exponential relation to size; evidently fundamental
	to most animals, warm-blooded or not. The basal metabolic rate is
	consequently not influenced by such factors as temperature gradient
	and insulation which largely determine the heat loss, and is hence
	inadaptive to climate. Equally inadaptive is the body temperature,

	has taken place only through factors that regulate the heat dissipation,

	the evolution of cooperation using an agent-based prisoner's dilemma

	endogenous heat production before 3 weeks of age and do not huddle
	effectively during cold exposure, gaining little thermoregulatory
	benefit from the presence of multiple littermates. In contrast, infant
	Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) produce heat endogenously and are
	effective at maintaining elevated body temperatures by huddling.
	Therefore, the ineffective huddling of infant hamsters may be due
	to the absence of endogenous heat production. The huddling behavior
	of infants in mixed huddles of 8-day-old hamsters and weight-matched
	4-5-day-old rats was observed to explore this possibility. The results
	indicate that hamsters, even when cold, effectively gain access to
	heat-producing rats, supporting the idea that endothermy contributes
	to the behavior of huddling by providing heat to each individual
	and thermal stimuli to other infants to support aggregation.},

	rats, however, are capable of heat production shortly after birth

	control in the retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate
	nucleus reduces variation in the presynaptic drive due to differences
	in input patterns, while homeostatic plasticity of V1 neuron excitability
	reduces the postsynaptic variability in firing rates. Together these
	two mechanisms, thought to be applicable across sensory systems in
	general, lead to biological maps that develop stably and robustly,
	yet adapt to the visual environment. The modeling results suggest
	that topographic map stability is a natural outcome of low-level
	processes of adaptation and normalization. The resulting model is
	more realistic, simpler, and far more robust, and is thus a good
	starting point for future studies of cortical map development.},

  abstract = {The reunification of embryology with evolutionary biology is impeded
	by the perception that a phylogenetic view of homology is incompatible
	with a developmental approach. This dichotomy disappears when developmental
	information is viewed not as pre-existing within the zygote but as
	being constructed during development. Developmental information can
	be depicted as the surface of an epigenetic landscape. An epigenetic
	landscape, in turn, can be viewed as a series of aligned energy landscapes
	that change shape and become more complex as development proceeds.
	In this view, individual valley bottoms are attractors in state space
	that tend to reappear reliably in successive generations. Phylogeny
	can therefore be conceptualized as a succession of epigenetic landscapes,
	and homologues can be identified as corresponding valleys that have
	reappeared reliably since their origin in a single ancestral population.
	Epigenetic homologues can be robust to phylogenetic changes in developmental
	mechanisms, precursors, and lower level characters. Although application
	of the epigenetic homology concept is complicated by the lack of
	explicit information about the topography of epigenetic landscapes,
	comparative biologists can learn to identify recurring ontogenetic
	patterns in a manner that is analogous to the identification of input
	patterns by attractor neural networks. The correspondence of epigenetic
	valleys is therefore not defined by any essential criteria but by
	their overlap in multidimensional state space. Whether corresponding
	valleys are homologous to each other must be determined by a phylogenetic
	analysis using cladistic methods. Among the general implications
	of epigenetic homology for comparative neurobiology is that the concept
	of 'field homology' should be used with caution when dealing with
	novel characters. A case study, applying an epigenetic perspective
	to understand the variation in monkey visual cortex observed after
	developmental perturbations, is presented in a final section to make

	studies employ constant T(a) to measure metabolic rates. In particular,
	exposure to a daily temperature cycle, even within rest shelters,
	may be important in timing of torpor and arousal and determining
	resting energy costs in wild animals. We tested how captive bats
	(Nyctophilus geoffroyi; 7 g) exposed to a diurnal T(a) fluctuation
	(between 13 degrees C and 27 degrees C), similar to natural conditions
	in their summer tree roosts, adjusted the timing of daily arousals.
	To distinguish the effects of T(a) and passive rewarming from time
	of the day, we shifted the heating phase to commence at 06:00 h,
	09:00 h or 12:00 h on each day. Bats entered torpor overnight and
	aroused the next day at a time corresponding to rising T(a) and passive
	rewarming. The critical T(a) (and torpid T(b)) for arousal was not
	fixed, however, but was lower when heating occurred later in the
	rest phase, providing the first evidence that the critical arousal
	T(a) is affected by time of the day. Bats re-entered torpor in response
	to cooling late in the afternoon, yet always aroused at lights off.
	A period of normothermic thermoregulation was therefore closely synchronised
	with maximum daily T(a), indicating a trade-off between the benefits
	and energetic costs of normothermia during resting. Our experiment
	clearly shows that a daily T(a) cycle affects the thermoregulatory
	behaviour and energetics of these small bats. More generally, these

	type of economic, non-profit organization and their role in contributing
	to the economic and social growth of the country. The purpose of
	this paper is to learn more about the experience of the Italian social
	cooperatives in promoting the work integration process of disadvantaged
	workers, especially those suffering from mental disorders, from a
	theoretical and an empirical point of view. Social enterprise is
	the most popular and consolidated legal and organizational model
	for social enterprises in Italy, introduced by Law 381/91. Developed
	during the early 1980s, and formally recognized by law in the early
	1990s, social cooperatives aim at pursuing the general interest of
	the community to promote the human needs and social inclusion of
	citizens. They are orientated towards aims that go beyond the interest
	of the business owners, the primary beneficiary of their activities
	is the community, or groups of disadvantaged people. In Italy, Law
	381/91 distinguishes between two categories of social cooperatives,
	those producing goods of social utility, such as culture, welfare
	and educational services (A-type), and those providing economic activities
	for the integration of disadvantaged people into employment (B-type).
	The main purpose of B-type social cooperatives is to integrate disadvantaged
	people into the open labour market. This goal is reached after a
	period of training and working experience inside the firm, during
	which the staff works to improve both the social and professional
	abilities of disadvantaged people. During the years, B-type social
	co-ops acquired a particular relevance in the care of people with
	mental disorders by offering them with job opportunities. Having
	a job is central in the recovery process of people suffering from
	mental diseases, meaning that B-type social co-ops in Italy play
	an important rehabilitative and integrative role for this vulnerable
	population of workers. The recent literature has highlighted that
	difficulties with employment are a feature of mental disorders, with
	high unemployment rates and short job tenure. Yet, success in employment
	for this population can be expected when they are provided with adequate
	support and opportunities. B-type social cooperatives in Italy are
	found to be very useful in order to help this disadvantaged category
	of workers find and keep a job. The work environment is more flexible
	and allows a better integration with less stigma and better work
	accommodations compared to the open labour market and/or other public/private
	organizations. Results from B-type Italian social cooperatives studies
	show that mentally ill workers value the importance of working, are
	highly satisfied with their job, are motivated to continue working,
	are engaged in their job and willing to work in the competitive labour
	market. Also, studies show that environmental characteristics of
	the social cooperative, such as the implementation of work accommodations
	and the possibility to work in an environment that is highly supportive,
	have an impact on increasing the likelihood of being highly satisfied
	with the job, which in turn is positively related to job tenure.
	In sum, this article shed light on the historical background that
	led to the development of social cooperatives in Italy. Furthermore,
	the features of B-type co-ops that play a central role in facilitating
	the work integration of people with mental disorders are described
	in this paper. In general, Italian B-type social cooperatives are
	found to provide a meaningful work experience to people with mental
	disorders, that help them increase not only vocational outcomes,
	but also psycho-social outcomes, and generally to help them better
	integrate into society.},

  abstract = {Ever since Richards proposed his flexible growth function more than
	half a century ago, it has been a mystery that this empirical function
	has made many incredible coincidences with real ecological or epidemic
	data even though one of its parameters (i.e., the exponential term)
	does not seem to have clear biological meaning. It is therefore a
	natural challenge to mathematical biologists to provide an explanation
	of the interesting coincidences and a biological interpretation of
	the parameter. Here we start from a simple epidemic SIR model to
	revisit Richards model via an intrinsic relation between both models.
	Especially, we prove that the exponential term in the Richards model
	has a one-to-one nonlinear correspondence to the basic reproduction
	number of the SIR model. This one-to-one relation provides us an
	explicit formula in calculating the basic reproduction number. Another
	biological significance of our study is the observation that the
	peak time is approximately just a serial interval after the turning
	point. Moreover, we provide an explicit relation between final outbreak
	size, basic reproduction number and the peak epidemic size which
	means that we can predict the final outbreak size shortly after the
	peak time. Finally, we introduce a constraint in Richards model to
	address over fitting problem observed in the existing studies and
	then apply our method with constraint to conduct some validation
	analysis using the data of recent outbreaks of prototype infectious
	diseases such as Canada 2009 H1N1 outbreak, GTA 2003 SARS outbreak,
	Singapore 2005 dengue outbreak, and Taiwan 2003 SARS outbreak. Our
	new formula gives much more stable and precise estimate of model
	parameters and key epidemic characteristics such as the final outbreak
	size, the basic reproduction number, and the turning point, compared
	with earlier simulations without constraints.},

	In this mathematical model, each individual penguin in the huddle
	seeks only to reduce its own heat loss. Consequently, penguins on
	the boundary of the huddle that are most exposed to the wind move
	downwind to more sheltered locations along the boundary. In contrast,
	penguins in the interior of the huddle neither have the space to
	move nor experience a significant heat loss, and they therefore remain
	stationary. Through these individual movements, the entire huddle
	experiences a robust cumulative effect that we identify, describe,

	wind flowing around the huddle and of the resulting temperature distribution.
	Both of these must be recomputed each time an individual penguin
	moves since the huddle shape changes. Using our simulation results,
	we find that the key parameters affecting the huddle dynamics are
	the number of penguins in the huddle, the wind strength, and the
	amount of uncertainty in the movement of the penguins. Moreover,
	we find that the lone assumption of individual penguins minimizing
	their own heat loss results in all penguins having approximately

	in cortical feature maps? We ask this question of four major theories
	of cortical map formation: self-organizing maps, wiring optimization,

	maps yield spatial patterning only as a by-product of efficient mechanisms
	for developing environmentally appropriate distributions of feature
	preferences, (ii) wiring optimization assumes rather than explains
	a map-like organization, (iii) place-coding mechanisms can at best
	explain only a subset of maps in functional terms, and (iv) reaction-diffusion
	models suggest two factors in the evolution of maps, the first based
	on efficient development of feature distributions, and the second
	based on generating feature-specific long-range recurrent cortical
	circuitry. None of these explanations for the existence of topological
	maps requires spatial patterning in maps to be useful. Thus despite
	these useful frameworks for understanding how maps form and how they

	in the evolution of mammalian neocortex cannot be rejected. The article

  abstract = {The place theory proposed by Jeffress (1948) is still the dominant
	model of how the brain represents the movement of sensory stimuli
	between sensory receptors. According to the place theory, delays
	in signalling between neurons, dependent on the distances between
	them, compensate for time differences in the stimulation of sensory
	receptors. Hence the location of neurons, activated by the coincident
	arrival of multiple signals, reports the stimulus movement velocity.
	Despite its generality, most evidence for the place theory has been
	provided by studies of the auditory system of auditory specialists
	like the barn owl, but in the study of mammalian auditory systems
	the evidence is inconclusive. We ask to what extent the somatosensory
	systems of tactile specialists like rats and mice use distance dependent
	delays between neurons to compute the motion of tactile stimuli between
	the facial whiskers (or 'vibrissae'). We present a model in which
	synaptic inputs evoked by whisker deflections arrive at neurons in
	layer 2/3 (L2/3) somatosensory 'barrel' cortex at different times.
	The timing of synaptic inputs to each neuron depends on its location
	relative to sources of input in layer 4 (L4) that represent stimulation
	of each whisker. Constrained by the geometry and timing of projections
	from L4 to L2/3, the model can account for a range of experimentally
	measured responses to two-whisker stimuli. Consistent with that data,
	responses of model neurons located between the barrels to paired
	stimulation of two whiskers are greater than the sum of the responses
	to either whisker input alone. The model predicts that for neurons
	located closer to either barrel these supralinear responses are tuned
	for longer inter-whisker stimulation intervals, yielding a topographic
	map for the inter-whisker deflection interval across the surface
	of L2/3. This map constitutes a neural place code for the relative
	timing of sensory stimuli.},

  abstract = {Based on measuring responses to rat whiskers as they are mechanically
	stimulated, one recent study suggests that barrel-related areas in
	layer 2/3 rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contain a pinwheel
	map of whisker motion directions. Because this map is reminiscent
	of topographic organization for visual direction in primary visual
	cortex (V1) of higher mammals, we asked whether the S1 pinwheels
	could be explained by an input-driven developmental process as is
	often suggested for V1. We developed a computational model to capture
	how whisker stimuli are conveyed to supragranular S1, and simulate
	lateral cortical interactions using an established self-organizing
	algorithm. Inputs to the model each represent the deflection of a
	subset of 25 whiskers as they are contacted by a moving stimulus
	object. The subset of deflected whiskers corresponds with the shape
	of the stimulus, and the deflection direction corresponds with the
	movement direction of the stimulus. If these two features of the
	inputs are correlated during the training of the model, a somatotopically
	aligned map of direction emerges for each whisker in S1. Predictions
	of the model that are immediately testable include (1) that somatotopic
	pinwheel maps of whisker direction exist in adult layer 2/3 barrel
	cortex for every large whisker on the rat's face, even peripheral
	whiskers; and (2) in the adult, neurons with similar directional
	tuning are interconnected by a network of horizontal connections,
	spanning distances of many whisker representations. We also propose
	specific experiments for testing the predictions of the model by
	manipulating patterns of whisker inputs experienced during early
	development. The results suggest that similar intracortical mechanisms

  abstract = {It is a vexing problem to achieve a consensus about the proper scientific
	way to assess population viability for habitat conservation plans.
	Rather than a hypothesis-testing approach, here it is proposed to
	select population models, estimate extinction parameters, and assess
	prediction uncertainty using a pragmatic, empirical Bayesian approach.
	The simplest usable models include the effects of population growth,
	r; carrying capacity, K; Allee threshold, N(A); and environmental
	stochasticity, v(r). Analytic predictions of expected extinction
	times are available for such models. Models that are more complex
	can be elaborated from this basis. Selection from a hierarchy of
	nesting population models can often be done through the evaluation
	of parameters. The estimation of the most important extinction parameters
	can be undertaken in a variety of ways. Time series can be analyzed
	to estimate r(d), v(r), rho, and K. Habitat models and individualistic
	population models may help estimate N(A) and K and demographic stochasticity.
	Fine-scale biogeography and climatological data may be useful in
	the estimation of a variety of parameters. Because it takes many
	years to estimate extinction parameters accurately for a given population
	of interest, the most efficient estimation procedures are desirable.
	I propose the use of prior information from an (as yet nonexistent)
	population biology database. The accumulation of local information
	through monitoring will improve our estimates allowing adaptive management.
	Uncertainty in the estimates will always remain, but it may be quantified
	by the posterior distributions. A crude example is discussed using
	treefrog population data. Although the motivations, beliefs, and
	biases of competing stakeholders will differ, a habitat conservation
	plan could accommodate this variation in the prior distributions.
	Field experience from monitoring will increasingly clear up any discrepancies
	between the opposing beliefs and the real ecosystem. As the world
	is an uncertain place and because there is no universal scientific
	method, there will always be controversy and surprises. The best
	we can do is (1) agree about our prior information, (2) agree about
	the strategy of model selection and parameter estimation, and (3)
	agree about our strategy for adaptive management. Perhaps the greatest
	impediment to such prior agreements for HCPs is the likely paranoia
	inspired by the use of unfamiliar statistical methodology. We need
	to train students of ecology in a more flexible and deeper understanding
	of statistics and philosophy of science.},
