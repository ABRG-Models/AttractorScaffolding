# Plotting scripts

The scripts here make plots of the data generated by the programs in
../sim/

This repository is distributed with the data results reported in the
paper stored in ../data/. Some of the data that these scripts plot
will need to be re-generated with the relevant simulation program.

Plot the paper figures 1B, 1C and 1D with plot_figB.py, plot_figC.py
and plot_figD.py.

Further investigate the evolution speed (Fig 1D) with plot_evospeed.py.
