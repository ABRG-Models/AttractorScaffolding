# Plotting scripts

The scripts here make plots of the data generated by the programs in
../sim/ and write graphs into ./png/ (in either png or svg format).

The data for the results reported in the paper is stored in
../data/. Some of the data that these scripts plot will need to be
re-generated with the relevant simulation programs.

Plot the paper figures 1B, 1C and 1D with plot_figB.py, plot_figC.py
and plot_figD.py.

Further investigate the evolution speed (Fig 1D) with plot_evospeed.py
and plot_evospeed_histo_only_multi.py.

### plot_dimension_tree.py

First run:

```
build/sim/dimension_tree 4
build/sim/dimension_tree 5
build/sim/dimension_tree 6 # (etc)
```

Then plot:
```
python plot_dimension_tree.py 4
python plot_dimension_tree.py 5 # (etc)
```

### plot_drift.py

First run:
```
scripts/rundrift.sh
```
Then plot:
```
python plot_drift.py
```

### plot_evo_analysis.py

**Needs attention**

Then plot:
```
python plot_.py
```

### plot_evospeed_bf.py and plot_evospeed_histo_only_multi_bf.py

First run:
```
scripts/runevolveb.sh
```
Then plot:
```
python plot_evospeed_bf.py
python plot_evospeed_histo_only_multi_bf.py
```

### plot_evospeed_histo_only_multi.py, plot_evospeed_powerlaw.py and plot_evospeed.py

First run:
```
scripts/runevolve.sh
```
Then plot:
```
python plot_evospeed.py
python plot_evospeed_histo_only_multi.py
python plot_evospeed_powerlaw.py
```

### plot_figB.py

This script runs without generating any data:
```
python plot_figB.py
```

### plot_figC.py

The data to plot fig C are part of this repository. To generate more
data, run
```
build/sim/evolve_withf 0.1
```
Then plot:
```
python plot_figC.py
```

### plot_figD.py, plot_figDloglog.py and plot_figDlognorm.py

These operate on the data generated by runevolve.sh, which is already
present in the repository:
```
python plot_figD.py
python plot_figDloglog.py  # Alternatives to plot_figD.py
python plot_figDlognorm.py
```

### plot_fitincspeed_histo_multi.py

data/evolve_a21_p10_ff4_100000000_gensplus*.csv files run :
```
scripts/runevolve.sh
```
Then plot (this one takes a long time as it plots the distribution of
ALL the fitness increments, rather than just f=1 genomes):
```
python plot_fitincspeed_histo_multi.py
```

### plot_fitness_dists.py

The data is in the repository for this script. Regenerate with
estimate_fitness_dist_ff4 etc.

To plot:
```
python plot_fitness_dists.py
```

### plot_h_m.py

The results of running h_m.cpp are in the repository. Consult h_m.cpp
for details. Plot with:
```
python plot_h_m.py
```

### plot_null_stats.py and plot_null_stats_load.py

Plots statistics of the null model. What script to run to generate the
null model data?

Then plot:
```
python plot_.py
```

### plot_p0.py

Plots the probability of obtaining a zero fitness as a function of the
length of the limit cycle into which the initial state
transitions. The results are generated using,, but stored in the
repository so don't need to be regenerated.

```
python plot_p0.py
```

### plot_prob_fitinc_flipbits.py

Plots statistics for the probability of the fitness increasing as a
function of the number of bits flipped.

First run:
```
scripts/run_prob_fitinc_bybits.sh
```
Then plot:
```
python plot_prob_fitinc_bybits.py
```

### plot_prob_fitinc.py

Plots statistics for the probability of the fitness increasing as a
function of the probability of flipping a bit.

First run:
```
scripts/run_prob_fitinc.sh
```
Then plot:
```
python plot_prob_fitinc.py
```

### plot_smooth_fit.py

Plots the fitness of genomes as they are mutated away from f=1
genomes. The data is in the repository, to regenerate it run:
```
scripts/runmutations4.sh
scripts/runmutations5.sh
scripts/runmutations6.sh
```
Then plot:
```
python plot_smooth_fit.py
```

### plot_states_bitflips.py

First run:
```
scripts/rundrift.sh
```
Then plot:
```
python plot_.py
```
